I am a second year EECS M.S. student and former C.S. Undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I'm broadly interested in multi-agent robotics, particularly how to enable their efficient cooperation through custom hardware, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Some recent projects include [enabling quadrapeds to cooperatively tow a box with multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18221) and [using diffusion models to design computer chips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12282).

On the side, I enjoy bouldering and upgrading my home lab.
