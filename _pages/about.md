I am a second year EECS M.S. student and former C.S. Undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I work at the [SLICE Lab](https://slice.eecs.berkeley.edu/) on Domain Specific Acceleration for Robotic Workloads. Some projects I've worked on here include: [Accelerating Model Predictive Control(MPC)](https://www.minh02.com/assets/pdf/MPCAccelerationPoster.pdf) with Gemmini, SLICE's systolic array generator, [modifying said generator](https://www.minh02.com/assets/pdf/GEMVPoster.pdf) to have better utilization in robotic workloads, and utilizing High Level Synthesis to [map C++ MPC code onto an FPGA](https://www.minh02.com/assets/pdf/FPGAMPCPoster.pdf). I am also working on Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning with the [Hybrid Robotics Lab](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/) where I am using reinforcement learning to enable multi-agent cooperation.

On the side, I enjoy bouldering and upgrading my home lab.
