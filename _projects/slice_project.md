I'm a Master's student in the SLICE Lab advised by Sophia Shao. I mainly work on Domain Specific Acceleration (DSE) for robotics applications which ranges from developing robotic workloads to benchmark to designing novel accelerators for important robotic kernels. The cover image is from when I took Berkeley's Tapeout Course where we went through the ASIC VLSI flow of designing RTL to getting a physical chip back from a foundry. I was part of the DSP Convolution team which built an accelerator for audio processing applications.

I've attached some of my retreat posters below.
