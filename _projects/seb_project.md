I joined Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) my 2nd year of undergraduate, which was my first year on campus after the pandemic. The work and people there were amazing and I'm amazed at the progress I was able to contribute to over the course of the next 2 years. Definitely check out the [SEB website](https://www.berkeleyse.org/) for current work.

### Euraka 1

Our first attempt at a liquid rocket launch was a great time for me. I contributed to a total rewrite of the pre-existing firmware and got my hands dirty with a custom avionics system.

### E-Reg

The goal behind **E**lectronic-**Reg**ulator was to create a throttlable liquid rocket engine for future SEB launches. This was achieved through motor-actuated valves that could control the flow rate of propellant to the engine. In this project, I once again wrote the firmware and designed PCBs to control the system. It was not all smooth sailing though and countless nights were spent trying to get the system functional enough to test. I still remember staying up all night in the Mojave Desert probing the boards with a microcontroller trying to discover the cause behind dropped packets. The end result was definitely worth it though.
