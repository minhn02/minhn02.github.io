My current PC is housed in a Small Form Factor (SFF) case. It was my first time building in such a small case so there were complications with fitting parts in and cable management, but I think it turned out well.

The core components are an Intel i5-12600k with an Nvidia GTX 1080. The full components list can be found [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/TheMinja/saved/hRjBqs). The upside of a small case is that its very portable (except the monitors) which made it easy to transport to L.A. and back to Berkeley. The case does have thermal issues however and the fans are constantly on. I will probably stick to small cases in the future for the convienence but maybe invest in better fans.

The GPU is getting outdated at this point, so I'm looking to upgrade but their prices have been outlandish recently.
