I've experimented with building and using a couple of different keyboards, but have mostly stopped getting new keyboards since they're fairly pricey...

My current keyboard is a [Think6.5 V2](https://graystudio.club/products/gb-think6-5-v2) which has a 65% layout. I soldered in [62g Zelio V2 Switches](https://zealpc.net/products/zealio?variant=6502846147) + lube which I enjoy a lot.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/proj_keyboard/keyboard_think65.jpeg" title="keyboard_think" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

At JPL, I used a [HKKB Professional Type S](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid-type-s), which I initially didn't like the feel of the switches and the layout. After a while though, I enjoyed the typing experience + the portability.

I've built an [Ergodox](https://www.ergodox.io/https://www.ergodox.io/) split keyboard before, but couldn't get used to typing with it. The [Alice](https://www.lightningkeyboards.com/work-pt4/tgr-alice) keyboard layout seems like a less extreme version of this ergonomic concept that I would be willing to try, but the price is so high...
